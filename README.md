# Tree-Based-Pollution-Mitigation-Dashboard-

# 🌿 Tree-Based Pollution Mitigation Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This is an interactive Streamlit-based dashboard for analyzing air pollution data, identifying dominant pollutants, and recommending tree plantation strategies using both pollutant-type logic and seasonal wind directions.

## 🚀 Features
- Multi-City Comparison (Delhi, Bhubaneswar)
- Single-City Deep Analysis (line trends, heatmaps, correlations)
- Folium Maps for interactive city selection + wind overlay
- Rule-based tree plantation recommendations
- Downloadable summary reports

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair)
- Geospatial Mapping (Folium, Streamlit-Folium)

## 📊 Future Work
- Machine Learning forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)
- City & wind-specific action recommendations
- Expanded datasets (traffic, crop burning, weather)

## ▶️ Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KrutiBibhabPatra/Tree-Based-Pollution-Mitigation-Dashboard-
cd pollution-dashboard
streamlit run mapp.py
